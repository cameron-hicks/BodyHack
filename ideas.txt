PRIORITIES
-- in manifest: use browser-action's property default_icon to set extension's iconin the bookmarks bar
-- run the extension only on the homepage of blocked sites, not dependent pages: eg, Youtube's home page but not the pages of individual videos
-- countdown timer reach feature


BUGS



REACH FEATURES
-- countdown timer
-- code interactivity into the modal
-- fetch some workout images to get that API credit
-- Show a message when the user ends their browsing session by closing their browser window (not tab).
-- Gamify: Keep track across a browsing session (localStorage) of how many workout challenges user has completed. Display their score. Track high scores.
-- auto hydration reminder
--  ability for user to set preferred  workout category and see only moves from that category
-- display list of blocked sites in popup and allow user to add/remove sites from the list
-- Interface with an external resource to get Moves: draw Moves from an API or online resource
  -- adjust Move class's properties according to the kinds of information provided by that resource
-- Include instructions with each Move: https://www.fatherly.com/health-science/easy-workout-quick-workout/
    -- perhaps as a toggle div that displays only if they click the name of the move?



TUTORIALS
-- investigate using JQuery to make a fake alert message with styles: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/How-I-can-change-the-style-of-alert-box-using-JavaScript
-- more information about the tabs: https://medium.com/@berraknil/building-a-chrome-extension-tips-and-tricks-ba95aa664ebe
-- try making a new window instead of adding new divs to current page. See: https://medium.com/@berraknil/building-a-chrome-extension-tips-and-tricks-ba95aa664ebe and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10340481/popup-window-in-chrome-extension




DONE 
-- make a class for workout move objects
-- properties: HTML element node, move name, workout category, targeted muscle group
-- fill an array with workout moves
-- use Math.random to randomly select indices in the array
-- append randomly selected workout moves to a popup modal in the html file of the current tab
-- refreshes sometimes
-- on complex websites like Twitter, it seems like the page may reload up to 3 times, executing main.js (and our alert) 3 times as well. Once-ifying our alert function seemed to help on some websites, but on others we're still generating 3 distinct alerts.
-- clean minimum styling of blocker div: font size, font weight, bolding, new lines, font color
-- set a timer/timeout on the popup so that it can't be closed before enough time has passed for the user to do a workout
  -- use setTimeout() to set a timer to delay displaying a close-window button on the popup; until that button appears, you can only close the popup by exiting the page entirely
  -- selectMoves() can return an array containing duplicates. (I think I may have fixed this while refactoring)
